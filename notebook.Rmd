This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

spy <- read.table(file="C:/Users/ramy_/Documents/Graduate School/Semester 2/Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization/final_project/SPY.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

btc <- read.table(file="C:/Users/ramy_/Documents/Graduate School/Semester 2/Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization/final_project/btc.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

eth <- read.table(file="C:/Users/ramy_/Documents/Graduate School/Semester 2/Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization/final_project/eth.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")


```



```{r}

library(ggplot2)
#btc$Date <- as.Date(btc$Date, "%d-%s-%Y")


ggplot(btc, aes(Date, Open)) + geom_line()


```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
